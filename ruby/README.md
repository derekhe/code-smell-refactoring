## What is a code smell?

* Ever had a smelly fridge?
* A human intuition that it might be time to cleanup your codebase
* Patterns that indicate there could be trouble








## Are they always a problem?

* No! Think of them as guidelines rather than rules
* Not every problem is as clear cut as our examples will show











## How can I fix them?

* Refactoring: change code WITHOUT CHANGING BEHAVIOR
* A set of patterns that you can apply systematically

## Let's get to the code already!

If you'd like to follow along, here is how this works:

Each folder contains a small example that highlights a particular code smell. There are tests included to make sure you don't break anything while refactoring.

The `assault_course` is a slightly larger example that combines various code smells and can be used to test out your refactoring chops.

For instructions on how to run the tests for a given smell, see the `README` in each folder.
